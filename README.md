# Lives Claimed by Terrorism  in 2016
 [Lives Claimed by Terrorism Globe](https://puyush6889.github.io/CapitalOneChallenge/) | Capital One Global Data Visualization 
### What I built
* I created an interactive web application to analyze the lives claimed by terrorist attacks throughout 2016
* I also enabled the user to evaluate 3 different data sets to see how they compare to one another
* The user can use the [WebGL Globe](https://www.chromeexperiments.com/globe) in my application to get a bigger picture of how areas in the world line up to each other in my these 3 different data sets from multiple sources
* I also took this project as an opportunity to improve my web development skills - relating to the product and the process

### What I used
* I created JSON data for parsing as both files and arrays
* I used the [Google Charts API](https://developers.google.com/chart/) for a diverse set of data visualization
* I used some jQuery, and I also used Materialize framerwork for a responsive front-end
* Data compiled from: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_terrorist_incidents)
