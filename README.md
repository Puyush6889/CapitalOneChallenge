# Lives Claimed by Terrorism  in 2016
 [Lives Claimed by Terrorism Globe](https://puyush6889.github.io/CapitalOneChallenge/) | Capital One Global Data Visualization Challenge
### What I built
* I created an interactive web application to analyze the lives claimed by terrorist attacks throughout 2016
* I added different visualization tools from google to express the lives claimed by Terrorism
* The user can use the [WebGL Globe](https://www.chromeexperiments.com/globe) in my application.
* I also took this project as an opportunity to improve my web development skills - relating to the product and the process

### What I used
* I created JSON data for parsing as both files and arrays to show the data on the globe
* I used the [Google Charts API](https://developers.google.com/chart/) for a diverse set of data visualization
* I used some jQuery, and I also used Materialize framerwork for a responsive front-end
* Data compiled from: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_terrorist_incidents)
